<a name="l2"><span class="linenum">   2</span></a>                         Version 3, 29 June 2007
<a name="l3"><span class="linenum">   3</span></a>  
<a name="l4"><span class="linenum">   4</span></a>   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
<a name="l5"><span class="linenum">   5</span></a>   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<a name="l6"><span class="linenum">   6</span></a>   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<a name="l7"><span class="linenum">   7</span></a>  
<a name="l8"><span class="linenum">   8</span></a>                              Preamble
<a name="l9"><span class="linenum">   9</span></a>  
<a name="l10"><span class="linenum">  10</span></a>    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<a name="l11"><span class="linenum">  11</span></a>  software and other kinds of works.
<a name="l12"><span class="linenum">  12</span></a>  
<a name="l13"><span class="linenum">  13</span></a>    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<a name="l14"><span class="linenum">  14</span></a>  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<a name="l15"><span class="linenum">  15</span></a>  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<a name="l16"><span class="linenum">  16</span></a>  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<a name="l17"><span class="linenum">  17</span></a>  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<a name="l18"><span class="linenum">  18</span></a>  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<a name="l19"><span class="linenum">  19</span></a>  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<a name="l20"><span class="linenum">  20</span></a>  your programs, too.
<a name="l21"><span class="linenum">  21</span></a>  
<a name="l22"><span class="linenum">  22</span></a>    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<a name="l23"><span class="linenum">  23</span></a>  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<a name="l24"><span class="linenum">  24</span></a>  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<a name="l25"><span class="linenum">  25</span></a>  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<a name="l26"><span class="linenum">  26</span></a>  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<a name="l27"><span class="linenum">  27</span></a>  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<a name="l28"><span class="linenum">  28</span></a>  
<a name="l29"><span class="linenum">  29</span></a>    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<a name="l30"><span class="linenum">  30</span></a>  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<a name="l31"><span class="linenum">  31</span></a>  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<a name="l32"><span class="linenum">  32</span></a>  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<a name="l33"><span class="linenum">  33</span></a>  
<a name="l34"><span class="linenum">  34</span></a>    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<a name="l35"><span class="linenum">  35</span></a>  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<a name="l36"><span class="linenum">  36</span></a>  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<a name="l37"><span class="linenum">  37</span></a>  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<a name="l38"><span class="linenum">  38</span></a>  know their rights.
<a name="l39"><span class="linenum">  39</span></a>  
<a name="l40"><span class="linenum">  40</span></a>    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<a name="l41"><span class="linenum">  41</span></a>  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<a name="l42"><span class="linenum">  42</span></a>  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<a name="l43"><span class="linenum">  43</span></a>  
<a name="l44"><span class="linenum">  44</span></a>    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<a name="l45"><span class="linenum">  45</span></a>  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<a name="l46"><span class="linenum">  46</span></a>  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<a name="l47"><span class="linenum">  47</span></a>  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<a name="l48"><span class="linenum">  48</span></a>  authors of previous versions.
<a name="l49"><span class="linenum">  49</span></a>  
<a name="l50"><span class="linenum">  50</span></a>    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<a name="l51"><span class="linenum">  51</span></a>  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<a name="l52"><span class="linenum">  52</span></a>  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<a name="l53"><span class="linenum">  53</span></a>  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<a name="l54"><span class="linenum">  54</span></a>  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<a name="l55"><span class="linenum">  55</span></a>  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<a name="l56"><span class="linenum">  56</span></a>  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<a name="l57"><span class="linenum">  57</span></a>  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<a name="l58"><span class="linenum">  58</span></a>  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<a name="l59"><span class="linenum">  59</span></a>  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<a name="l60"><span class="linenum">  60</span></a>  
<a name="l61"><span class="linenum">  61</span></a>    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<a name="l62"><span class="linenum">  62</span></a>  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<a name="l63"><span class="linenum">  63</span></a>  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<a name="l64"><span class="linenum">  64</span></a>  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<a name="l65"><span class="linenum">  65</span></a>  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<a name="l66"><span class="linenum">  66</span></a>  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<a name="l67"><span class="linenum">  67</span></a>  
<a name="l68"><span class="linenum">  68</span></a>    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<a name="l69"><span class="linenum">  69</span></a>  modification follow.
<a name="l70"><span class="linenum">  70</span></a>  
<a name="l71"><span class="linenum">  71</span></a>                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a name="l72"><span class="linenum">  72</span></a>  
<a name="l73"><span class="linenum">  73</span></a>    0. Definitions.
<a name="l74"><span class="linenum">  74</span></a>  
<a name="l75"><span class="linenum">  75</span></a>    &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<a name="l76"><span class="linenum">  76</span></a>  
<a name="l77"><span class="linenum">  77</span></a>    &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<a name="l78"><span class="linenum">  78</span></a>  works, such as semiconductor masks.
<a name="l79"><span class="linenum">  79</span></a>  
<a name="l80"><span class="linenum">  80</span></a>    &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<a name="l81"><span class="linenum">  81</span></a>  License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
<a name="l82"><span class="linenum">  82</span></a>  &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
<a name="l83"><span class="linenum">  83</span></a>  
<a name="l84"><span class="linenum">  84</span></a>    To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<a name="l85"><span class="linenum">  85</span></a>  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<a name="l86"><span class="linenum">  86</span></a>  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
<a name="l87"><span class="linenum">  87</span></a>  earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
<a name="l88"><span class="linenum">  88</span></a>  
<a name="l89"><span class="linenum">  89</span></a>    A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<a name="l90"><span class="linenum">  90</span></a>  on the Program.
<a name="l91"><span class="linenum">  91</span></a>  
<a name="l92"><span class="linenum">  92</span></a>    To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
<a name="l93"><span class="linenum">  93</span></a>  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<a name="l94"><span class="linenum">  94</span></a>  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<a name="l95"><span class="linenum">  95</span></a>  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<a name="l96"><span class="linenum">  96</span></a>  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<a name="l97"><span class="linenum">  97</span></a>  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<a name="l98"><span class="linenum">  98</span></a>  
<a name="l99"><span class="linenum">  99</span></a>    To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<a name="l100"><span class="linenum"> 100</span></a>  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<a name="l101"><span class="linenum"> 101</span></a>  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<a name="l102"><span class="linenum"> 102</span></a>  
<a name="l103"><span class="linenum"> 103</span></a>    An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
<a name="l104"><span class="linenum"> 104</span></a>  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<a name="l105"><span class="linenum"> 105</span></a>  feature <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('that')" href="_functions/that.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'that')">that</a> (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<a name="l106"><span class="linenum"> 106</span></a>  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<a name="l107"><span class="linenum"> 107</span></a>  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<a name="l108"><span class="linenum"> 108</span></a>  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<a name="l109"><span class="linenum"> 109</span></a>  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<a name="l110"><span class="linenum"> 110</span></a>  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<a name="l111"><span class="linenum"> 111</span></a>  
<a name="l112"><span class="linenum"> 112</span></a>    1. Source Code.
<a name="l113"><span class="linenum"> 113</span></a>  
<a name="l114"><span class="linenum"> 114</span></a>    The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
<a name="l115"><span class="linenum"> 115</span></a>  for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
<a name="l116"><span class="linenum"> 116</span></a>  form of a work.
<a name="l117"><span class="linenum"> 117</span></a>  
<a name="l118"><span class="linenum"> 118</span></a>    A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
<a name="l119"><span class="linenum"> 119</span></a>  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<a name="l120"><span class="linenum"> 120</span></a>  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<a name="l121"><span class="linenum"> 121</span></a>  is widely used among developers working in that language.
<a name="l122"><span class="linenum"> 122</span></a>  
<a name="l123"><span class="linenum"> 123</span></a>    The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
<a name="l124"><span class="linenum"> 124</span></a>  than the work as a whole, <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('that')" href="_functions/that.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'that')">that</a> (a) is included in the normal form of
<a name="l125"><span class="linenum"> 125</span></a>  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<a name="l126"><span class="linenum"> 126</span></a>  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<a name="l127"><span class="linenum"> 127</span></a>  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<a name="l128"><span class="linenum"> 128</span></a>  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<a name="l129"><span class="linenum"> 129</span></a>  &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
<a name="l130"><span class="linenum"> 130</span></a>  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<a name="l131"><span class="linenum"> 131</span></a>  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<a name="l132"><span class="linenum"> 132</span></a>  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<a name="l133"><span class="linenum"> 133</span></a>  
<a name="l134"><span class="linenum"> 134</span></a>    The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
<a name="l135"><span class="linenum"> 135</span></a>  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<a name="l136"><span class="linenum"> 136</span></a>  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<a name="l137"><span class="linenum"> 137</span></a>  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<a name="l138"><span class="linenum"> 138</span></a>  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<a name="l139"><span class="linenum"> 139</span></a>  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<a name="l140"><span class="linenum"> 140</span></a>  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<a name="l141"><span class="linenum"> 141</span></a>  includes <span class="keyword">interface </span><a class="class" onClick="logClass('definition')" href="_classes/definition.html" onMouseOver="classPopup(event,'definition')">definition</a> files associated with source files for
<a name="l142"><span class="linenum"> 142</span></a>  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<a name="l143"><span class="linenum"> 143</span></a>  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<a name="l144"><span class="linenum"> 144</span></a>  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<a name="l145"><span class="linenum"> 145</span></a>  subprograms and other parts of the work.
<a name="l146"><span class="linenum"> 146</span></a>  
<a name="l147"><span class="linenum"> 147</span></a>    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<a name="l148"><span class="linenum"> 148</span></a>  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<a name="l149"><span class="linenum"> 149</span></a>  Source.
<a name="l150"><span class="linenum"> 150</span></a>  
<a name="l151"><span class="linenum"> 151</span></a>    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<a name="l152"><span class="linenum"> 152</span></a>  same work.
<a name="l153"><span class="linenum"> 153</span></a>  
<a name="l154"><span class="linenum"> 154</span></a>    2. Basic Permissions.
<a name="l155"><span class="linenum"> 155</span></a>  
<a name="l156"><span class="linenum"> 156</span></a>    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<a name="l157"><span class="linenum"> 157</span></a>  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<a name="l158"><span class="linenum"> 158</span></a>  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<a name="l159"><span class="linenum"> 159</span></a>  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<a name="l160"><span class="linenum"> 160</span></a>  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<a name="l161"><span class="linenum"> 161</span></a>  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<a name="l162"><span class="linenum"> 162</span></a>  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<a name="l163"><span class="linenum"> 163</span></a>  
<a name="l164"><span class="linenum"> 164</span></a>    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<a name="l165"><span class="linenum"> 165</span></a>  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<a name="l166"><span class="linenum"> 166</span></a>  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<a name="l167"><span class="linenum"> 167</span></a>  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<a name="l168"><span class="linenum"> 168</span></a>  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<a name="l169"><span class="linenum"> 169</span></a>  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<a name="l170"><span class="linenum"> 170</span></a>  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<a name="l171"><span class="linenum"> 171</span></a>  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<a name="l172"><span class="linenum"> 172</span></a>  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<a name="l173"><span class="linenum"> 173</span></a>  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<a name="l174"><span class="linenum"> 174</span></a>  
<a name="l175"><span class="linenum"> 175</span></a>    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<a name="l176"><span class="linenum"> 176</span></a>  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<a name="l177"><span class="linenum"> 177</span></a>  makes it unnecessary.
<a name="l178"><span class="linenum"> 178</span></a>  
<a name="l179"><span class="linenum"> 179</span></a>    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<a name="l180"><span class="linenum"> 180</span></a>  
<a name="l181"><span class="linenum"> 181</span></a>    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<a name="l182"><span class="linenum"> 182</span></a>  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<a name="l183"><span class="linenum"> 183</span></a>  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<a name="l184"><span class="linenum"> 184</span></a>  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<a name="l185"><span class="linenum"> 185</span></a>  measures.
<a name="l186"><span class="linenum"> 186</span></a>  
<a name="l187"><span class="linenum"> 187</span></a>    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<a name="l188"><span class="linenum"> 188</span></a>  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<a name="l189"><span class="linenum"> 189</span></a>  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<a name="l190"><span class="linenum"> 190</span></a>  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<a name="l191"><span class="linenum"> 191</span></a>  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<a name="l192"><span class="linenum"> 192</span></a>  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<a name="l193"><span class="linenum"> 193</span></a>  technological measures.
<a name="l194"><span class="linenum"> 194</span></a>  
<a name="l195"><span class="linenum"> 195</span></a>    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<a name="l196"><span class="linenum"> 196</span></a>  
<a name="l197"><span class="linenum"> 197</span></a>    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<a name="l198"><span class="linenum"> 198</span></a>  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<a name="l199"><span class="linenum"> 199</span></a>  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<a name="l200"><span class="linenum"> 200</span></a>  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<a name="l201"><span class="linenum"> 201</span></a>  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<a name="l202"><span class="linenum"> 202</span></a>  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<a name="l203"><span class="linenum"> 203</span></a>  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<a name="l204"><span class="linenum"> 204</span></a>  
<a name="l205"><span class="linenum"> 205</span></a>    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<a name="l206"><span class="linenum"> 206</span></a>  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<a name="l207"><span class="linenum"> 207</span></a>  
<a name="l208"><span class="linenum"> 208</span></a>    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<a name="l209"><span class="linenum"> 209</span></a>  
<a name="l210"><span class="linenum"> 210</span></a>    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<a name="l211"><span class="linenum"> 211</span></a>  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<a name="l212"><span class="linenum"> 212</span></a>  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<a name="l213"><span class="linenum"> 213</span></a>  
<a name="l214"><span class="linenum"> 214</span></a>      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<a name="l215"><span class="linenum"> 215</span></a>      it, and giving a relevant date.
<a name="l216"><span class="linenum"> 216</span></a>  
<a name="l217"><span class="linenum"> 217</span></a>      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<a name="l218"><span class="linenum"> 218</span></a>      released under this License and any conditions added under section
<a name="l219"><span class="linenum"> 219</span></a>      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<a name="l220"><span class="linenum"> 220</span></a>      &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
<a name="l221"><span class="linenum"> 221</span></a>  
<a name="l222"><span class="linenum"> 222</span></a>      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<a name="l223"><span class="linenum"> 223</span></a>      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<a name="l224"><span class="linenum"> 224</span></a>      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<a name="l225"><span class="linenum"> 225</span></a>      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<a name="l226"><span class="linenum"> 226</span></a>      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<a name="l227"><span class="linenum"> 227</span></a>      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<a name="l228"><span class="linenum"> 228</span></a>      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<a name="l229"><span class="linenum"> 229</span></a>  
<a name="l230"><span class="linenum"> 230</span></a>      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<a name="l231"><span class="linenum"> 231</span></a>      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<a name="l232"><span class="linenum"> 232</span></a>      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<a name="l233"><span class="linenum"> 233</span></a>      work need not make them do so.
<a name="l234"><span class="linenum"> 234</span></a>  
<a name="l235"><span class="linenum"> 235</span></a>    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<a name="l236"><span class="linenum"> 236</span></a>  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<a name="l237"><span class="linenum"> 237</span></a>  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<a name="l238"><span class="linenum"> 238</span></a>  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<a name="l239"><span class="linenum"> 239</span></a>  &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<a name="l240"><span class="linenum"> 240</span></a>  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<a name="l241"><span class="linenum"> 241</span></a>  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<a name="l242"><span class="linenum"> 242</span></a>  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<a name="l243"><span class="linenum"> 243</span></a>  parts of the aggregate.
<a name="l244"><span class="linenum"> 244</span></a>  
<a name="l245"><span class="linenum"> 245</span></a>    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<a name="l246"><span class="linenum"> 246</span></a>  
<a name="l247"><span class="linenum"> 247</span></a>    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<a name="l248"><span class="linenum"> 248</span></a>  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<a name="l249"><span class="linenum"> 249</span></a>  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<a name="l250"><span class="linenum"> 250</span></a>  in one of these ways:
<a name="l251"><span class="linenum"> 251</span></a>  
<a name="l252"><span class="linenum"> 252</span></a>      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<a name="l253"><span class="linenum"> 253</span></a>      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<a name="l254"><span class="linenum"> 254</span></a>      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<a name="l255"><span class="linenum"> 255</span></a>      customarily used for software interchange.
<a name="l256"><span class="linenum"> 256</span></a>  
<a name="l257"><span class="linenum"> 257</span></a>      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<a name="l258"><span class="linenum"> 258</span></a>      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<a name="l259"><span class="linenum"> 259</span></a>      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<a name="l260"><span class="linenum"> 260</span></a>      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<a name="l261"><span class="linenum"> 261</span></a>      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<a name="l262"><span class="linenum"> 262</span></a>      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<a name="l263"><span class="linenum"> 263</span></a>      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<a name="l264"><span class="linenum"> 264</span></a>      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<a name="l265"><span class="linenum"> 265</span></a>      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<a name="l266"><span class="linenum"> 266</span></a>      conveying of source, <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('or')" href="_functions/or.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'or')">or</a> (2) access to copy the
<a name="l267"><span class="linenum"> 267</span></a>      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<a name="l268"><span class="linenum"> 268</span></a>  
<a name="l269"><span class="linenum"> 269</span></a>      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<a name="l270"><span class="linenum"> 270</span></a>      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<a name="l271"><span class="linenum"> 271</span></a>      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<a name="l272"><span class="linenum"> 272</span></a>      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<a name="l273"><span class="linenum"> 273</span></a>      with subsection 6b.
<a name="l274"><span class="linenum"> 274</span></a>  
<a name="l275"><span class="linenum"> 275</span></a>      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<a name="l276"><span class="linenum"> 276</span></a>      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<a name="l277"><span class="linenum"> 277</span></a>      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<a name="l278"><span class="linenum"> 278</span></a>      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<a name="l279"><span class="linenum"> 279</span></a>      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<a name="l280"><span class="linenum"> 280</span></a>      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<a name="l281"><span class="linenum"> 281</span></a>      may be on a different <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('server')" href="_functions/server.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'server')">server</a> (operated by you or a third party)
<a name="l282"><span class="linenum"> 282</span></a>      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<a name="l283"><span class="linenum"> 283</span></a>      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<a name="l284"><span class="linenum"> 284</span></a>      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<a name="l285"><span class="linenum"> 285</span></a>      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<a name="l286"><span class="linenum"> 286</span></a>      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<a name="l287"><span class="linenum"> 287</span></a>  
<a name="l288"><span class="linenum"> 288</span></a>      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<a name="l289"><span class="linenum"> 289</span></a>      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<a name="l290"><span class="linenum"> 290</span></a>      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<a name="l291"><span class="linenum"> 291</span></a>      charge under subsection 6d.
<a name="l292"><span class="linenum"> 292</span></a>  
<a name="l293"><span class="linenum"> 293</span></a>    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<a name="l294"><span class="linenum"> 294</span></a>  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<a name="l295"><span class="linenum"> 295</span></a>  included in conveying the object code work.
<a name="l296"><span class="linenum"> 296</span></a>  
<a name="l297"><span class="linenum"> 297</span></a>    A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
<a name="l298"><span class="linenum"> 298</span></a>  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<a name="l299"><span class="linenum"> 299</span></a>  or household purposes, <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('or')" href="_functions/or.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'or')">or</a> (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<a name="l300"><span class="linenum"> 300</span></a>  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<a name="l301"><span class="linenum"> 301</span></a>  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<a name="l302"><span class="linenum"> 302</span></a>  product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
<a name="l303"><span class="linenum"> 303</span></a>  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<a name="l304"><span class="linenum"> 304</span></a>  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<a name="l305"><span class="linenum"> 305</span></a>  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<a name="l306"><span class="linenum"> 306</span></a>  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<a name="l307"><span class="linenum"> 307</span></a>  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<a name="l308"><span class="linenum"> 308</span></a>  the only significant mode of use of the product.
<a name="l309"><span class="linenum"> 309</span></a>  
<a name="l310"><span class="linenum"> 310</span></a>    &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
<a name="l311"><span class="linenum"> 311</span></a>  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<a name="l312"><span class="linenum"> 312</span></a>  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<a name="l313"><span class="linenum"> 313</span></a>  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<a name="l314"><span class="linenum"> 314</span></a>  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<a name="l315"><span class="linenum"> 315</span></a>  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<a name="l316"><span class="linenum"> 316</span></a>  modification has been made.
<a name="l317"><span class="linenum"> 317</span></a>  
<a name="l318"><span class="linenum"> 318</span></a>    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<a name="l319"><span class="linenum"> 319</span></a>  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<a name="l320"><span class="linenum"> 320</span></a>  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<a name="l321"><span class="linenum"> 321</span></a>  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<a name="l322"><span class="linenum"> 322</span></a>  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<a name="l323"><span class="linenum"> 323</span></a>  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<a name="l324"><span class="linenum"> 324</span></a>  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<a name="l325"><span class="linenum"> 325</span></a>  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<a name="l326"><span class="linenum"> 326</span></a>  modified object code on the User <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('Product')" href="_functions/product.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'product')">Product</a> (for example, the work has
<a name="l327"><span class="linenum"> 327</span></a>  been installed in ROM).
<a name="l328"><span class="linenum"> 328</span></a>  
<a name="l329"><span class="linenum"> 329</span></a>    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<a name="l330"><span class="linenum"> 330</span></a>  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<a name="l331"><span class="linenum"> 331</span></a>  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<a name="l332"><span class="linenum"> 332</span></a>  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<a name="l333"><span class="linenum"> 333</span></a>  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<a name="l334"><span class="linenum"> 334</span></a>  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<a name="l335"><span class="linenum"> 335</span></a>  protocols for communication across the network.
<a name="l336"><span class="linenum"> 336</span></a>  
<a name="l337"><span class="linenum"> 337</span></a>    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<a name="l338"><span class="linenum"> 338</span></a>  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<a name="l339"><span class="linenum"> 339</span></a>  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<a name="l340"><span class="linenum"> 340</span></a>  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<a name="l341"><span class="linenum"> 341</span></a>  unpacking, reading or copying.
<a name="l342"><span class="linenum"> 342</span></a>  
<a name="l343"><span class="linenum"> 343</span></a>    7. Additional Terms.
<a name="l344"><span class="linenum"> 344</span></a>  
<a name="l345"><span class="linenum"> 345</span></a>    &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
<a name="l346"><span class="linenum"> 346</span></a>  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<a name="l347"><span class="linenum"> 347</span></a>  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<a name="l348"><span class="linenum"> 348</span></a>  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<a name="l349"><span class="linenum"> 349</span></a>  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<a name="l350"><span class="linenum"> 350</span></a>  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<a name="l351"><span class="linenum"> 351</span></a>  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<a name="l352"><span class="linenum"> 352</span></a>  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<a name="l353"><span class="linenum"> 353</span></a>  
<a name="l354"><span class="linenum"> 354</span></a>    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<a name="l355"><span class="linenum"> 355</span></a>  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<a name="l356"><span class="linenum"> 356</span></a>  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<a name="l357"><span class="linenum"> 357</span></a>  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<a name="l358"><span class="linenum"> 358</span></a>  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<a name="l359"><span class="linenum"> 359</span></a>  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<a name="l360"><span class="linenum"> 360</span></a>  
<a name="l361"><span class="linenum"> 361</span></a>    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<a name="l362"><span class="linenum"> 362</span></a>  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<a name="l363"><span class="linenum"> 363</span></a>  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<a name="l364"><span class="linenum"> 364</span></a>  
<a name="l365"><span class="linenum"> 365</span></a>      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<a name="l366"><span class="linenum"> 366</span></a>      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<a name="l367"><span class="linenum"> 367</span></a>  
<a name="l368"><span class="linenum"> 368</span></a>      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<a name="l369"><span class="linenum"> 369</span></a>      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<a name="l370"><span class="linenum"> 370</span></a>      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<a name="l371"><span class="linenum"> 371</span></a>  
<a name="l372"><span class="linenum"> 372</span></a>      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<a name="l373"><span class="linenum"> 373</span></a>      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<a name="l374"><span class="linenum"> 374</span></a>      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<a name="l375"><span class="linenum"> 375</span></a>  
<a name="l376"><span class="linenum"> 376</span></a>      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<a name="l377"><span class="linenum"> 377</span></a>      authors of the material; or
<a name="l378"><span class="linenum"> 378</span></a>  
<a name="l379"><span class="linenum"> 379</span></a>      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<a name="l380"><span class="linenum"> 380</span></a>      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<a name="l381"><span class="linenum"> 381</span></a>  
<a name="l382"><span class="linenum"> 382</span></a>      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<a name="l383"><span class="linenum"> 383</span></a>      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<a name="l384"><span class="linenum"> 384</span></a>      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<a name="l385"><span class="linenum"> 385</span></a>      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<a name="l386"><span class="linenum"> 386</span></a>      those licensors and authors.
<a name="l387"><span class="linenum"> 387</span></a>  
<a name="l388"><span class="linenum"> 388</span></a>    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
<a name="l389"><span class="linenum"> 389</span></a>  restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<a name="l390"><span class="linenum"> 390</span></a>  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<a name="l391"><span class="linenum"> 391</span></a>  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<a name="l392"><span class="linenum"> 392</span></a>  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<a name="l393"><span class="linenum"> 393</span></a>  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<a name="l394"><span class="linenum"> 394</span></a>  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<a name="l395"><span class="linenum"> 395</span></a>  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<a name="l396"><span class="linenum"> 396</span></a>  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<a name="l397"><span class="linenum"> 397</span></a>  
<a name="l398"><span class="linenum"> 398</span></a>    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<a name="l399"><span class="linenum"> 399</span></a>  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<a name="l400"><span class="linenum"> 400</span></a>  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<a name="l401"><span class="linenum"> 401</span></a>  where to find the applicable terms.
<a name="l402"><span class="linenum"> 402</span></a>  
<a name="l403"><span class="linenum"> 403</span></a>    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<a name="l404"><span class="linenum"> 404</span></a>  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<a name="l405"><span class="linenum"> 405</span></a>  the above requirements apply either way.
<a name="l406"><span class="linenum"> 406</span></a>  
<a name="l407"><span class="linenum"> 407</span></a>    8. Termination.
<a name="l408"><span class="linenum"> 408</span></a>  
<a name="l409"><span class="linenum"> 409</span></a>    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<a name="l410"><span class="linenum"> 410</span></a>  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<a name="l411"><span class="linenum"> 411</span></a>  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<a name="l412"><span class="linenum"> 412</span></a>  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<a name="l413"><span class="linenum"> 413</span></a>  paragraph of section 11).
<a name="l414"><span class="linenum"> 414</span></a>  
<a name="l415"><span class="linenum"> 415</span></a>    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<a name="l416"><span class="linenum"> 416</span></a>  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<a name="l417"><span class="linenum"> 417</span></a>  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<a name="l418"><span class="linenum"> 418</span></a>  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<a name="l419"><span class="linenum"> 419</span></a>  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<a name="l420"><span class="linenum"> 420</span></a>  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<a name="l421"><span class="linenum"> 421</span></a>  
<a name="l422"><span class="linenum"> 422</span></a>    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<a name="l423"><span class="linenum"> 423</span></a>  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<a name="l424"><span class="linenum"> 424</span></a>  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<a name="l425"><span class="linenum"> 425</span></a>  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<a name="l426"><span class="linenum"> 426</span></a>  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<a name="l427"><span class="linenum"> 427</span></a>  your receipt of the notice.
<a name="l428"><span class="linenum"> 428</span></a>  
<a name="l429"><span class="linenum"> 429</span></a>    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<a name="l430"><span class="linenum"> 430</span></a>  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<a name="l431"><span class="linenum"> 431</span></a>  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<a name="l432"><span class="linenum"> 432</span></a>  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<a name="l433"><span class="linenum"> 433</span></a>  material under section 10.
<a name="l434"><span class="linenum"> 434</span></a>  
<a name="l435"><span class="linenum"> 435</span></a>    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<a name="l436"><span class="linenum"> 436</span></a>  
<a name="l437"><span class="linenum"> 437</span></a>    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<a name="l438"><span class="linenum"> 438</span></a>  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<a name="l439"><span class="linenum"> 439</span></a>  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<a name="l440"><span class="linenum"> 440</span></a>  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<a name="l441"><span class="linenum"> 441</span></a>  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<a name="l442"><span class="linenum"> 442</span></a>  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<a name="l443"><span class="linenum"> 443</span></a>  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<a name="l444"><span class="linenum"> 444</span></a>  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<a name="l445"><span class="linenum"> 445</span></a>  
<a name="l446"><span class="linenum"> 446</span></a>    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<a name="l447"><span class="linenum"> 447</span></a>  
<a name="l448"><span class="linenum"> 448</span></a>    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<a name="l449"><span class="linenum"> 449</span></a>  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<a name="l450"><span class="linenum"> 450</span></a>  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<a name="l451"><span class="linenum"> 451</span></a>  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<a name="l452"><span class="linenum"> 452</span></a>  
<a name="l453"><span class="linenum"> 453</span></a>    An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
<a name="l454"><span class="linenum"> 454</span></a>  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<a name="l455"><span class="linenum"> 455</span></a>  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<a name="l456"><span class="linenum"> 456</span></a>  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<a name="l457"><span class="linenum"> 457</span></a>  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<a name="l458"><span class="linenum"> 458</span></a>  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<a name="l459"><span class="linenum"> 459</span></a>  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<a name="l460"><span class="linenum"> 460</span></a>  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<a name="l461"><span class="linenum"> 461</span></a>  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<a name="l462"><span class="linenum"> 462</span></a>  
<a name="l463"><span class="linenum"> 463</span></a>    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<a name="l464"><span class="linenum"> 464</span></a>  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<a name="l465"><span class="linenum"> 465</span></a>  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<a name="l466"><span class="linenum"> 466</span></a>  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<a name="l467"><span class="linenum"> 467</span></a>  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<a name="l468"><span class="linenum"> 468</span></a>  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<a name="l469"><span class="linenum"> 469</span></a>  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<a name="l470"><span class="linenum"> 470</span></a>  
<a name="l471"><span class="linenum"> 471</span></a>    11. Patents.
<a name="l472"><span class="linenum"> 472</span></a>  
<a name="l473"><span class="linenum"> 473</span></a>    A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<a name="l474"><span class="linenum"> 474</span></a>  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<a name="l475"><span class="linenum"> 475</span></a>  work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.
<a name="l476"><span class="linenum"> 476</span></a>  
<a name="l477"><span class="linenum"> 477</span></a>    A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
<a name="l478"><span class="linenum"> 478</span></a>  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<a name="l479"><span class="linenum"> 479</span></a>  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<a name="l480"><span class="linenum"> 480</span></a>  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<a name="l481"><span class="linenum"> 481</span></a>  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<a name="l482"><span class="linenum"> 482</span></a>  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<a name="l483"><span class="linenum"> 483</span></a>  purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
<a name="l484"><span class="linenum"> 484</span></a>  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<a name="l485"><span class="linenum"> 485</span></a>  this License.
<a name="l486"><span class="linenum"> 486</span></a>  
<a name="l487"><span class="linenum"> 487</span></a>    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<a name="l488"><span class="linenum"> 488</span></a>  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<a name="l489"><span class="linenum"> 489</span></a>  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<a name="l490"><span class="linenum"> 490</span></a>  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<a name="l491"><span class="linenum"> 491</span></a>  
<a name="l492"><span class="linenum"> 492</span></a>    In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
<a name="l493"><span class="linenum"> 493</span></a>  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<a name="l494"><span class="linenum"> 494</span></a>  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<a name="l495"><span class="linenum"> 495</span></a>  sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
<a name="l496"><span class="linenum"> 496</span></a>  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<a name="l497"><span class="linenum"> 497</span></a>  patent against the party.
<a name="l498"><span class="linenum"> 498</span></a>  
<a name="l499"><span class="linenum"> 499</span></a>    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<a name="l500"><span class="linenum"> 500</span></a>  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<a name="l501"><span class="linenum"> 501</span></a>  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<a name="l502"><span class="linenum"> 502</span></a>  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<a name="l503"><span class="linenum"> 503</span></a>  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<a name="l504"><span class="linenum"> 504</span></a>  available, <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('or')" href="_functions/or.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'or')">or</a> (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<a name="l505"><span class="linenum"> 505</span></a>  patent license for this particular work, <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('or')" href="_functions/or.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'or')">or</a> (3) arrange, in a manner
<a name="l506"><span class="linenum"> 506</span></a>  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<a name="l507"><span class="linenum"> 507</span></a>  license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
<a name="l508"><span class="linenum"> 508</span></a>  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<a name="l509"><span class="linenum"> 509</span></a>  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<a name="l510"><span class="linenum"> 510</span></a>  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<a name="l511"><span class="linenum"> 511</span></a>  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<a name="l512"><span class="linenum"> 512</span></a>  
<a name="l513"><span class="linenum"> 513</span></a>    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<a name="l514"><span class="linenum"> 514</span></a>  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<a name="l515"><span class="linenum"> 515</span></a>  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<a name="l516"><span class="linenum"> 516</span></a>  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<a name="l517"><span class="linenum"> 517</span></a>  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<a name="l518"><span class="linenum"> 518</span></a>  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<a name="l519"><span class="linenum"> 519</span></a>  work and works based on it.
<a name="l520"><span class="linenum"> 520</span></a>  
<a name="l521"><span class="linenum"> 521</span></a>    A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
<a name="l522"><span class="linenum"> 522</span></a>  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<a name="l523"><span class="linenum"> 523</span></a>  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<a name="l524"><span class="linenum"> 524</span></a>  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<a name="l525"><span class="linenum"> 525</span></a>  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<a name="l526"><span class="linenum"> 526</span></a>  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<a name="l527"><span class="linenum"> 527</span></a>  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<a name="l528"><span class="linenum"> 528</span></a>  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<a name="l529"><span class="linenum"> 529</span></a>  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<a name="l530"><span class="linenum"> 530</span></a>  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<a name="l531"><span class="linenum"> 531</span></a>  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), <a class="function" onClick="logFunction('or')" href="_functions/or.html" onMouseOver="funcPopup(event,'or')">or</a> (b) primarily
<a name="l532"><span class="linenum"> 532</span></a>  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<a name="l533"><span class="linenum"> 533</span></a>  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<a name="l534"><span class="linenum"> 534</span></a>  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<a name="l535"><span class="linenum"> 535</span></a>  
<a name="l536"><span class="linenum"> 536</span></a>    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<a name="l537"><span class="linenum"> 537</span></a>  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<a name="l538"><span class="linenum"> 538</span></a>  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<a name="l539"><span class="linenum"> 539</span></a>  
<a name="l540"><span class="linenum"> 540</span></a>    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<a name="l541"><span class="linenum"> 541</span></a>  
<a name="l542"><span class="linenum"> 542</span></a>    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<a name="l543"><span class="linenum"> 543</span></a>  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<a name="l544"><span class="linenum"> 544</span></a>  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<a name="l545"><span class="linenum"> 545</span></a>  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<a name="l546"><span class="linenum"> 546</span></a>  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<a name="l547"><span class="linenum"> 547</span></a>  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<a name="l548"><span class="linenum"> 548</span></a>  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<a name="l549"><span class="linenum"> 549</span></a>  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<a name="l550"><span class="linenum"> 550</span></a>  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<a name="l551"><span class="linenum"> 551</span></a>  
<a name="l552"><span class="linenum"> 552</span></a>    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<a name="l553"><span class="linenum"> 553</span></a>  
<a name="l554"><span class="linenum"> 554</span></a>    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<a name="l555"><span class="linenum"> 555</span></a>  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<a name="l556"><span class="linenum"> 556</span></a>  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<a name="l557"><span class="linenum"> 557</span></a>  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<a name="l558"><span class="linenum"> 558</span></a>  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<a name="l559"><span class="linenum"> 559</span></a>  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<a name="l560"><span class="linenum"> 560</span></a>  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<a name="l561"><span class="linenum"> 561</span></a>  combination as such.
<a name="l562"><span class="linenum"> 562</span></a>  
<a name="l563"><span class="linenum"> 563</span></a>    14. Revised Versions of this License.
<a name="l564"><span class="linenum"> 564</span></a>  
<a name="l565"><span class="linenum"> 565</span></a>    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<a name="l566"><span class="linenum"> 566</span></a>  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<a name="l567"><span class="linenum"> 567</span></a>  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<a name="l568"><span class="linenum"> 568</span></a>  address new problems or concerns.
<a name="l569"><span class="linenum"> 569</span></a>  
<a name="l570"><span class="linenum"> 570</span></a>    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<a name="l571"><span class="linenum"> 571</span></a>  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<a name="l572"><span class="linenum"> 572</span></a>  Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
<a name="l573"><span class="linenum"> 573</span></a>  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<a name="l574"><span class="linenum"> 574</span></a>  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<a name="l575"><span class="linenum"> 575</span></a>  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<a name="l576"><span class="linenum"> 576</span></a>  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<a name="l577"><span class="linenum"> 577</span></a>  by the Free Software Foundation.
<a name="l578"><span class="linenum"> 578</span></a>  
<a name="l579"><span class="linenum"> 579</span></a>    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<a name="l580"><span class="linenum"> 580</span></a>  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<a name="l581"><span class="linenum"> 581</span></a>  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<a name="l582"><span class="linenum"> 582</span></a>  to choose that version for the Program.
<a name="l583"><span class="linenum"> 583</span></a>  
<a name="l584"><span class="linenum"> 584</span></a>    Later license versions may give you additional or different
<a name="l585"><span class="linenum"> 585</span></a>  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<a name="l586"><span class="linenum"> 586</span></a>  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<a name="l587"><span class="linenum"> 587</span></a>  later version.
<a name="l588"><span class="linenum"> 588</span></a>  
<a name="l589"><span class="linenum"> 589</span></a>    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<a name="l590"><span class="linenum"> 590</span></a>

<a name="l616"><span class="linenum"> 616</span></a>  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<a name="l617"><span class="linenum"> 617</span></a>  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<a name="l618"><span class="linenum"> 618</span></a>  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<a name="l619"><span class="linenum"> 619</span></a>  copy of the Program in return for a fee.

<a name="l623"><span class="linenum"> 623</span></a>              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<a name="l624"><span class="linenum"> 624</span></a>  
<a name="l625"><span class="linenum"> 625</span></a>    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<a name="l626"><span class="linenum"> 626</span></a>  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<a name="l627"><span class="linenum"> 627</span></a>  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<a name="l628"><span class="linenum"> 628</span></a>  
<a name="l629"><span class="linenum"> 629</span></a>    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<a name="l630"><span class="linenum"> 630</span></a>  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<a name="l631"><span class="linenum"> 631</span></a>  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<a name="l632"><span class="linenum"> 632</span></a>  the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<a name="l633"><span class="linenum"> 633</span></a>  
<a name="l634"><span class="linenum"> 634</span></a>      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

<a name="l646"><span class="linenum"> 646</span></a>  
<a name="l647"><span class="linenum"> 647</span></a>      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<a name="l648"><span class="linenum"> 648</span></a>      along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

<a name="l650"><span class="linenum"> 650</span></a>  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<a name="l651"><span class="linenum"> 651</span></a>  
<a name="l652"><span class="linenum"> 652</span></a>    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<a name="l653"><span class="linenum"> 653</span></a>  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<a name="l654"><span class="linenum"> 654</span></a>

<a name="l657"><span class="linenum"> 657</span></a>      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<a name="l658"><span class="linenum"> 658</span></a>      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<a name="l659"><span class="linenum"> 659</span></a>  
<a name="l660"><span class="linenum"> 660</span></a>  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<a name="l661"><span class="linenum"> 661</span></a>  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<a name="l662"><span class="linenum"> 662</span></a>  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.
<a name="l663"><span class="linenum"> 663</span></a>  
<a name="l664"><span class="linenum"> 664</span></a>    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<a name="l665"><span class="linenum"> 665</span></a>  if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.

<a name="l670"><span class="linenum"> 670</span></a>  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<a name="l671"><span class="linenum"> 671</span></a>  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<a name="l672"><span class="linenum"> 672</span></a>  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<a name="l673"><span class="linenum"> 673</span></a>  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
